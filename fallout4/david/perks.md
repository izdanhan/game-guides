With a **3256733** SPECIAL spread, you are perfectly positioned for a high-tech "Settlement Architect" run. **Sim Settlements 2 (SS2)** places a much heavier demand on resources, specialized crafting, and Charisma than the vanilla game.

Here are the best perks to prioritize for your first few levels to get the most out of SS2:

### 1. Scrapper (Intelligence 5) – **Priority: High**

In Sim Settlements 2, you are going to need massive amounts of screws, copper, and aluminum for ASAM sensors and plot upgrades.

* **Why:** Instead of just getting steel and wood, this lets you recover rare components from modified guns and armor you find on raiders.
* **SS2 Tip:** Build a "City Planner's Desk" early; Scrapper will help you keep it stocked with the components needed to craft your own ASAMs.

### 2. Local Leader (Charisma 6) – **Priority: Essential**

This is the backbone of any SS2 playthrough.

* **Why:** It allows you to establish **Supply Lines**. In SS2, your settlements need to share resources to grow effectively. Without this, each settlement is an island, and you'll find yourself manually hauling junk across the map.
* **SS2 Tip:** Rank 2 (available at Level 14) lets you build stores and workstations, which are required for some of the more advanced SS2 "Commercial" and "Municipal" plots.

### 3. Science! (Intelligence 6) – **Priority: High**

Your Intelligence is already high enough to grab this immediately.

* **Why:** SS2 relies heavily on "High Tech" power and industrial plots. You’ll need Science! to build the more efficient generators and water purifiers that support large, automated cities.
* **Combat Benefit:** Since your Agility and Luck are lower, you’ll likely rely on Energy Weapons or Power Armor; Science! is required to upgrade both.

### 4. Medic (Intelligence 2) – **Priority: Quality of Life**

SS2 introduces a **Disease System** where your settlers can actually get sick if sanitation is low.

* **Why:** While SS2 has its own "Hospital" plots, having the Medic perk allows you to craft better healing items and build your own chemistry stations to deal with early-game outbreaks before your city is fully automated.

### 5. Locksmith (Perception 4) or Hacker (Intelligence 4)

Since you have a **7 Intelligence**, you can be a master hacker from the start.

* **Recommendation:** Take **Hacker** first. You can use terminals to deactivate turrets or unlock safes that contain the high-tech scrap (circuits, etc.) you need for your SS2 plots.

### Suggested Early Leveling Path:

1. **Level 2:** **Scrapper** (To start hoarding rare materials)
2. **Level 3:** **Science!** (To unlock high-tech settlement plots)
3. **Level 4:** **Local Leader** (To prepare for supply lines)
4. **Level 5:** **Medic** or a Combat Perk (like **Rifleman** or **Gunslinger**)

**A quick tip for SS2:** Look for the **"Vit-o-Matic"** early in the SS2 questline. It lets you see your settlers' SPECIAL stats. In SS2, a settler with high Intelligence produces more power, while high Strength increases industrial output!

Would you like me to explain how your settlers' SPECIAL stats affect the different types of Sim Settlement plots?
