### **ACT I: THE NEON GHOST (Levels 1-25)**

-   **Objective:** Establish your reputation and financial footing. Build your core toolkit of deception and stealth. Get a ship that doesn't scream "target."
-   **Main Quest:** Follow the "Old Neighborhood" quest just far enough to get the Artifact and an invitation to Constellation. See them not as allies, but as a potential source of high-paying, high-risk work from wealthy eccentrics. **Stop after the Lodge.** Their mystery is a distraction from the next score.
-   **The Essential Questline:**
    -   **Ryujin Industries:** This is your top priority. It's a masterclass in corporate espionage, social manipulation, and silent extractions. The rewards aren't just credits‚Äîthey're the **Manipulation** skill and the **Operative Suit**, the perfect tools for a ghost.
    -   **First Contact (Paradiso):** A problem solvable with words or force, both of which you excel at. Pitch the corporate solution; it's the most profitable. Their offer of a lifetime discount is a better reward than a one-time payout.
-   **The Hustler's Grind:**
    -   Live on the Mission Boards. Prioritize **Transport** (smuggling), **Bounty Hunter**, and **Freestar Ranger** missions (if the target is dirty). These are your bread and butter.
    -   Your first major purchase is a **Shielded Cargo Hold** for your ship. Your second is a quality **suppressed weapon**.
    -   Your single most important goal is to achieve **Rank 3 in Persuasion** to talk your way past almost anyone.
-   **Ship & Gear:** Upgrade *The Event Horizon* (Razorleaf) for speed and stealth. Invest in engine upgrades and a scan jammer. You are a ghost, not a brawler. All credits go into tools that help you avoid fights or end them before they start.

### **ACT II: THE FACTION PLAYER (Levels 25-50)**

-   **Objective:** Infiltrate the major power structures of the Settled Systems. Turn their conflicts into your profit. Build a network of contacts and a fortune.
-   **The Turning Point:** You've made a name for yourself. Now it's time to play the great game.
    -   **Freestar Rangers:** Earn your badge. Not out of a sense of justice, but for the **Star Eagle** ship (a fantastic upgrade) and the system-wide authority that makes your life easier. Take down the corrupt First Cavalry not to save the day, but to claim their operation for yourself.
    -   **UC Vanguard / SysDef vs. Crimson Fleet:** This is the ultimate game. Infiltrate the **Crimson Fleet**. Your goal is dual: experience the unparalleled freedom and profit of life on the Key, and simultaneously play SysDef against them for the biggest possible payout. Betray everyone, trust no one, and walk away with a mountain of credits and loot from both sides.
    -   **Entangled (NASA Mission on Mars):** A job. Nothing more. The tech and data in there are worth a fortune to the right buyer. Retrieve everything that isn't nailed down.
-   **Advanced Operations:**
    -   Your wealth should be funneled into a custom **Class B ship**. Focus on massive cargo space (for smuggling), top-tier engines (for running), and EM weapons (for disabling and boarding).
    -   Establish a small, hidden outpost purely for storage of contraband and overflow loot. Its location must be remote and its existence known only to you.
-   **Legacy Hunts (Starfield Equivalents):**
    -   **The Mantis Lair:** Loot it. The gear is a powerful asset for any operative. Keep the ship or sell it; the legend of the Mantis is just another mask you can wear.
    -   **Colander Ship (Schrodinger III):** A potential goldmine of salvage and a terrifying story to tell in bars. Secure the site, eliminate any remaining threats, and strip it clean.

### **ACT III: THE KING OF GHOSTS (Levels 50+)**

-   **Objective:** Achieve ultimate freedom and financial dominance. Become a power broker who moves between factions unseen and untouchable.
-   **Faction Endgames:**
    -   Complete the **Ryujin** questline. The ability to manipulate anyone is the ultimate tool for a master manipulator. The corporate power you wield is a weapon in itself.
    -   Finish the **Crimson Fleet / SysDef** conflict. Choose the side that offers the best long-term benefits for your operations‚Äîbe it a permanent base of operations on the Key or a clean slate with the UC. This is a business decision.
-   **Constellation's Endgame:** Their quest for Artifacts is now relevant because it's the biggest, most mysterious score in the galaxy. The powers are not mystical gifts; they're new, marketable tools. Pursue them with the same ruthless efficiency you apply to any job.
-   **The Ultimate Project:**
    -   Using **Starship Design 4**, build your end-game vessel: a monstrous **Class C flagship**. It must be a paradox: fast enough to outrun SysDef interceptors, shielded enough to withstand a small fleet, and armed enough to dismantle anything that gets in your way. This ship is your final declaration of independence.
    -   Amass a personal fortune of over **1,000,000 credits**. Money is your scorecard.
-   **The Final Score:** Your end-game is freedom. The freedom to go anywhere, do anything, and buy anyone. You are not a hero saving the universe; you are its most successful problem, a sovereign entity of chaos and credit. The main quest's conclusion is just the biggest contract of your career. Collect your pay and disappear into the void, a legend whispered in every port from Neon to the Key.

## üó∫Ô∏è Regional Guide: How to Operate in the Settled Systems

-   **New Atlantis (Jemison):** The corporate and political heart. Your playground. Use the well-connected elites of the MAST district for high-society contracts. Use the Well for all your shady dealings. The UC Security presence is high; always have a convincing story ready.
-   **Akila City (Akila):** A place of "honorable" bounty hunters and dusty morals. A good place to pick up straightforward hunting work and sell stolen goods with fewer questions. The Rangers provide useful legal cover for your activities.
-   **Neon (Volii Alpha):** Home. You know the streets, the gangs, the corporate players. This is your natural habitat. Everything is for sale here, especially loyalty. Use your Ryujin connections to gain an edge. The Astral Lounge is the best place in the galaxy to find a new mark.
-   **Cydonia (Mars):** A grim mining town. The people are tough and poor. Good for moving common stolen goods and finding desperate, cheap muscle for a dirty job. Keep your visits short.
-   **The Key (Kryx):** The ultimate free port. This is where you come to offload hot merchandise, pick up the most illegal jobs, and rub shoulders with the most dangerous people in the galaxy. Act like you belong, because you do. Never show weakness.
-   **The Empty Quarter (Deep Space):** Not for sightseeing. This is where you go to meet contacts you can't be seen with, test illegal weapons, or hide from everyone who wants you dead. It's a tool, not a destination.

This path will transform you from a Neon gutter-rat into a king of the underworld, a ghost in the machine of the Settled Systems, utterly free and answerable to no one. Now go, and make the universe an offer it can't refuse.
