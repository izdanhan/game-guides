**Guiding Principle:** This plan prioritizes social manipulation, stealth, mobility, and economic dominance. The goal is to talk, sneak, or buy your way through any problem. When all else fails, a single, precise shot from the shadows is the answer. Your ship is your flagship, your sanctuary, and your ultimate tool for freedom.

### Progression Notes:
*   **Challenge Focus:** Always be working on Skill Challenges. Pick pockets (Stealth), buy and sell goods (Commerce), and successfully persuade people to quickly rank up your core skills. Use your ship's weapons to disable engines (Targeting Systems) for easy boarding.
*   **Credits & Resources:** Your primary income is quest rewards (always negotiated higher), stolen goods, and contraband. Invest heavily in the Commerce skill to maximize profits. The Trade Authority is your best friend and primary fence.
*   **Companions:** You are an **Extrovert**. While you may not fully trust them, you need a crew for their skills and to keep your energy up. Choose companions who are morally flexible (like Andreja) or who provide tangible ship benefits. Dismiss them only when a job specifically requires absolute solitude to trigger the **Isolation** damage bonus.
*   **The End-Game:** Your final build is not about raw power; it's about absolute control. You control conversations, you control the economy, you control the battlefield from the shadows, and you control the skies with an untouchable ship. You are a sovereign entity, utterly free and fabulously wealthy.
