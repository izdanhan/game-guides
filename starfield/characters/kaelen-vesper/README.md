### Character creation: Kaelen Vesper

**1. Background:**
*   **SELECT: [FILE NOT FOUND]**
    *   **In-Universe Justification:** This isn't an oversight; it's a feature. A clean(ish) slate. It suggests a past that has been deliberately scrubbed or is otherwise unaffiliated with the major powers, perfect for a self-made operative from the gritty streets of Neon. The bonus skills (Stealth, Security, Persuasion) are your entire core toolkit.

**2. Traits (Select Exactly 3):**
This is where your identity is forged. Do not deviate.

*   **SELECT: [WANTED]**
    *   **Roleplay Reason:** This is your reputation preceding you. It's not a flaw; it's a badge of honor. It means you were good enough to piss off someone powerful, and it ensures the Settled Systems never feel too safe. The occasional ambush is just a cost of doing business and a free delivery of loot and XP.
*   **SELECT: [EXTROVERT]**
    *   **Roleplay Reason:** You are a social creature. You feed on the energy of cantinas, starports, and your crew. This trait mandates your roleplay: you must seek out company, making you a more engaging and talkative character. The mechanical benefit is a perfect excuse to always have a companion in tow.
*   **SELECT: [SPACED]**
    *   **Roleplay Reason:** You were born in a port, you live on your ship, and you'll probably die in the cockpit. This trait cements your identity as a creature of the void. Your ship is your true home, and you are at your absolute best when you're in it, whether you're talking, trading, or fighting.

**3. Appearance:**
*   **Vibe:** Sharp, charismatic, but with a hint of weariness. Someone who has seen enough to be cynical but still finds it all amusing.
*   **Key Features:** Consider a scar or two—not too dramatic, but a "lesson learned." Hair should be stylish but practical. Keep the appearance memorable but not outrageous; a ghost shouldn't be *too* easy to describe.

**4. Starting Skills (From File Not Found):**
Your initial skills are perfect. They define your entire approach:
*   **Stealth (Rank 1):** Your first and best option is to avoid being seen.
*   **Security (Rank 1):** Because every locked door is an insult and a challenge.
*   **Persuasion (Rank 1):** Your primary weapon. Your mouth writes checks that your guns rarely have to cash.

**Initiate Sequence. The *Event Horizon* is waiting for its captain.**

### Core Concept & Identity
*   **Archetype:** The Charismatic Mercenary-Smuggler
*   **Vocation:** Freelance Problem-Solver & High-Stakes Courier
*   **Ship:** *The Event Horizon* (A sleek, heavily modified Razorleaf-class interceptor)
*   **Defining Quote:** *"The universe runs on three things: energy, information, and untraceable bullets. I deal in all three. What's your problem missing?"*

### Defining History & Motivations
*   **The Past:** A gutter-rat from the neon-drenched streets of Neon, Kael learned early that a sharp wit was more valuable than a sharp knife, and a trusted contact was better than a full credit chip. He wasn't born into a life of crime; he was forged by it, working his way up from running petty errands for Disciples muscle to being a sought-after neutral party for delicate negotiations and discreet deliveries.
*   **The Turning Point:** A job went sideways. A package he was paid to protect was seized by SysDef, and the client, a powerful Ryujin exec, left him out to dry. Facing a long stint in a Cyrocell, Kael learned the ultimate lesson: loyalty is a one-way street unless you're driving. He escaped, stole the ship he now calls home, and went truly independent.
*   **The Grand Mission:** He operates on a simple, brutal code: **The Vesper Accord**. 1. Get paid. 2. No questions asked. 3. The package *always* gets through. His reputation is his only currency, and he will burn a city to the ground to protect it. He's building a legend, one high-risk, high-reward job at a time.
*   **The Driving Force:** A deep-seated aversion to authority and a craving for the freedom of the open void. He doesn't seek to rule, only to be utterly ungovernable. Wealth is a means to that end—a bigger engine, a quieter grav drive, a more persuasive argument.

### Psychological Profile & Roleplay Guidelines
*   **Disposition:** Witty, fast-talking, and perpetually amused by the absurdity of it all. He uses humor as a weapon, a shield, and a tool to keep people off-balance. Underneath the charm is a core of hyper-vigilant cynicism.
*   **The Art of the Deal:** Violence is a failure of negotiation. He will always look for the angle, the bribe, the bluff, or the threat that gets him what he wants without a firefight. But if the fight comes, he ends it decisively.
*   **Lone Wolf, Pack Hunter:** He thrives on interaction but trusts no one. He'll work with a crew, banter with companions, and weave intricate webs of contacts, but he never fully lets his guard down. Everyone has a price, and he assumes his is just higher than most.
*   **Pragmatic Morality:** He is **Chaotic Neutral**. His alignment is to the job and his own skin. He can perform acts of genuine kindness for the right price or out of whimsy, and commit breathtaking betrayals for a better offer. The only sin is being boring.

### Traits & Their Roleplay Effects
*   **Wanted:**
    *   **Effect:** A mysterious faction has a bounty on your head, sending occasional hit squads.
    *   **Roleplay:** This isn't a mistake; it's a feature. It keeps him sharp, always watching the shadows. He wears the bounty as a badge of honor—proof he pissed off someone important enough to matter.
*   **Extrovert:**
    *   **Effect:** Gains strength from the company of others. Being alone is draining.
    *   **Roleplay:** He is a social creature. He frequens cantinas and starports not just for work, but to recharge. Long solo flights in the deep black leave him irritable and restless. He needs a crew, even if it's just for the noise.
*   **Spaced:**
    *   **Effect:** Born and comfortable in zero-g. Health and endurance are boosted in space.
    *   **Roleplay:** A ship is his true home; planets are just places to do business. He is more agile, more confident, and more in his element during ship combat and boarding actions. Terra firma feels slow and heavy.

### The Call to Adventure
The Starfield is Kael's chessboard, and everyone in it is a piece to be moved, sacrificed, or cashed in. The Constellation's noble quest for answers is either the biggest scam he's ever heard or the ultimate score. He isn't driven by mystery; he's driven by opportunity. He'll dive headfirst into faction wars, ancient mysteries, and corporate espionage not for glory or truth, but for the sheer, exhilarating challenge of it—and for the massive payday that's sure to be waiting at the end. Assuming, of course, he doesn't decide to keep it all for himself.
