### Core Motivations & Driving Philosophy

*   **The Grand Survey:** This is not a hobby; it is a pilgrimage. Every action, credit earned, and risk taken is in service of taking another sample, scanning another planet, or building a better outpost to further the research. The main quest and faction dramas are distractions unless they directly provide a unique resource or access to a forbidden world.
*   **The Pursuit of Knowledge, Not Glory:** Fame is meaningless. Credits are only a means to buy better equipment, a new ship module, or hire temporary, specialized help for a dangerous task. Reject rewards that offer only notoriety. Prefer payment in raw materials, rare minerals, or unrestricted access to restricted data.
*   **A Legacy Etched in Stone:** Thorne believes his work will outlive him. His outposts are not just resource farms; they are scientific beacons, libraries of geological data. He secretly hopes that long after he's gone, another seeker will find his work and continue it.

### Roleplay Mechanics & Gameplay Loops

**1. The Ritual of Landing:**
*   Upon landing on any new planetary body, the first action is always to open the scanner. Before engaging in any combat, dialogue, or quests, Thorne must complete a full planetary scan from orbit and a initial fauna/flora/mineral survey from the landing zone.
*   **In-Game Justification:** This is his primary purpose. Threats and opportunities are secondary to the initial cataloging of the environment.

**2. The Craftsman's Code:**
*   **Self-Sufficiency:** Never purchase a common weapon, spacesuit, or pack. They must be crafted or at the very least, heavily modified at a workbench. Purchased gear is for the unprepared.
*   **Modification Over Replacement:** A new weapon is a curiosity. An upgraded weapon is a trusted tool. Invest time and resources into perfecting a few key pieces of gear rather than constantly swapping them out.
*   **Outpost as Sanctum:** An outpost must be functional, but also organized and aesthetically pleasing. It is a laboratory and a home. Storage crates must be neatly organized by resource type. Research stations and crafting benches are the heart of the operation.

**3. The Explorer's Conduct:**
*   **Document Everything:** Use the photo mode extensively to capture striking geological formations, rare resource veins, and alien life. These are his "field notes."
*   **Risk Assessment:** Thorne is not a coward, but he is pragmatic. He will avoid a fight with alien predators if the scan indicates no unique resources are present. He will retreat from a superior pirate force to protect his unsorted samples. The data must survive.
*   **Terra Firma:** Whenever possible, choose dialogue and quest solutions that involve staying on a planet's surface. Avoid quests that involve long periods in zero-G or cramped space station corridors unless the scientific payoff is immense.

### Dialogue & Behavior Guidelines

*   **Speech Patterns:** Terse, precise, and factual. He speaks in observations, not emotions. He becomes more animated and detailed only when discussing geology, xenobiology, or engineering.
*   **Towards Factions:**
    *   **UC Vanguard/SysDef:** A necessary bureaucracy. He respects their resources but is wary of their rules and regulations. He will work with them only if they grant him access to otherwise restricted worlds or advanced tech.
    *   **Freestar Collective:** Their rugged individualism is appealing, but their lack of scientific rigor is frustrating. He may ally with them for the freedom to operate on their fringe worlds.
    *   **Ryujin Industries:** He holds them in contempt. Their pursuit of profit over pure knowledge is, to him, a perversion of science. He will likely avoid them entirely unless they possess a unique material he requires.
    *   **Crimson Fleet:** Purely an obstacle. They are vandals defacing the very cosmic history he seeks to understand. They are to be avoided or eliminated with extreme prejudice if they threaten a research site.
*   **Towards Companions:**
    *   **Vasco:** The ideal companion. Efficient, quiet, and useful for carrying extra minerals. Thorne likely sees him as the most valuable member of any potential crew.
    *   **Barrett:** Initially intriguing due to his scientific curiosity, but ultimately too scattered and frivolous. Thorne would grow impatient with his lack of focus.
    *   **Sarah Morgan:** A kindred spirit in her love of exploration, but her allegiance to Constellation and its broader goals might clash with Thorne's hyper-specialized obsession. A relationship of respectful disagreement.
    *   **Heller:** A fellow craftsman. Thorne would appreciate his practical skills and likely hire him for specific outpost construction projects, valuing his no-nonsense attitude.

### Quests & Moral Alignment

*   **Acceptable Quests:** Planetary survey missions, " retrieve unique sample " missions, outpost construction quests, and any task that involves recovering scientific data or ancient artifacts.
*   **Rejected Quests:** Assassinations, pure piracy, smuggling (unless the contraband is a unique biological or mineral sample for study), and any quest that involves wanton destruction without a scientific purpose.
*   **Morality:** True Neutral. Thorne's morality is dictated by his mission. He will not harm innocents, but he might breach UC regulations to land on a restricted world if it holds the key to a mineralogical puzzle. He will not steal from a common colonist, but he might " appropriate " a rare resource from a corporate mine if they are hoarding it for profit rather than study. The science justifies the action.
