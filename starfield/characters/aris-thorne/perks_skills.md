### Progression Notes:
*   **Challenge Focus:** Always be working on Skill Challenges. Use your cutter to mine (Lasers challenge), scan every new flora/fauna (Surveying challenge), and build outposts (Outpost Engineering challenge) to naturally rank up your core skills.
*   **Credits & Resources:** Your primary income will come from selling survey data to Vladimir Sall at The Eye and from manufactured goods from your outposts. Never sell rare resources; stockpile them for top-tier research.
*   **Companions:** You are an **Introvert**. Use companions only for specific skill-based tasks (e.g., Heller for outpost building) and then dismiss them to work alone for the oxygen and recovery benefits. Vasco is the ideal permanent crew member for your ship due to his utility and lack of social demands.
*   **The End-Game:** Your final build is not about dealing the most damage, but about having the capability to go *anywhere*, survive *anything*, and craft *everything*. You are the master of your environment.
