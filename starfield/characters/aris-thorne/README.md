### Core Concept & Identity
*   **Archetype:** The Grieving Scholar-Obsessive
*   **Vocation:** Xeno-Geologist & Independent Researcher
*   **Ship:** *The Forge* (A beat-up, modified Kepler-class scout ship)
*   **Defining Quote:** *"Every rock has a story. You just need to know how to listen. The ones out hereâ€¦ they sing songs of creation itself. And I intend to transcribe every last note."*

### Defining History & Motivations
*   **The Past:** A respected but unfulfilled Professor of Xeno-Geology at the University of Olympion on Mars. His life was theory and academia until it was shattered by the death of his wife and research partner, Elara, from a rare illness linked to unrefined Tiberium exposure.
*   **The Turning Point:** Her death caused a fundamental break. He rejected the "safe" confines of institutional science, liquidated his assets, and exiled himself into the void to pursue raw, hands-on discovery.
*   **The Grand Mission:** He is consumed by **The Grand Survey**, a self-appointed, obsessive quest to find a theoretical **"Primordial Litho-Key"**â€”a perfect crystalline structure he believes underpins all cosmic matter. This is his life's work, his penance, and his memorial to Elara.
*   **The Driving Force:** The belief that the universe's ultimate answers (to formation, artifacts, even human biology) are encoded not in words, but in the mineralogical DNA of planets. He seeks truth, not glory; understanding, not wealth.

### Psychological Profile & Roleplay Guidelines
*   **Disposition:** Terse, precise, and factual. He speaks in observations, not emotions. Becomes animated only when discussing geology, xenobiology, or engineering.
*   **Solitude as a Weapon:** His focus is sharpened by isolation. Crowds and small talk are a drain; the silent company of the stars is his solace.
*   **The Craftsman's Pride:** He holds contempt for the unprepared. Off-the-shelf gear is for amateurs; a true scientist engineers their own solutions. He modifies and improves everything he owns.
*   **Pragmatic Morality:** He is **True Neutral**. His morality is dictated by his mission. He won't harm innocents but will break any regulation or "appropriate" any resource if it serves the greater scientific purpose of The Grand Survey. The ends justify the means if the ends are knowledge.

### Traits & Their Roleplay Effects
*   **Introvert:**
    *   **Effect:** Works best alone. Finds companions draining over long periods.
    *   **Roleplay:** Prefers solo exploration. Hires crew only for specific, temporary tasks. His only true partner was his wife; without her, he relies on himself and his ship.
*   **Terra Firma:**
    *   **Effect:** Feels more capable and clear-minded on planetary surfaces.
    *   **Roleplay:** A planet's surface is his laboratory, a ship is a necessary transport module. He will always choose a path that keeps him grounded. He feels uneasy and confined in space stations or during long hauls.
*   **Taskmaster:**
    *   **Effect:** Demands precision and excellence from any hired crew.
    *   **Roleplay:** On the rare occasions he requires a crew, he is an exacting, demanding commander. He has no patience for error or laziness, often grating on those who don't share his obsessive standards. He barks orders with cold efficiency.

### The Call to Adventure
The Starfield is not a place of adventure for Aris Thorne; it is a library. Every new anomaly is a page to be read, every mineral signature a footnote to be decoded. He is a cartographer of creation's blueprint. He will brave pirate fleets, extreme environments, and profound loneliness to ask the oldest questions of the oldest stones, hoping one will finally answer. The main quest and faction dramas are merely distractions unless they provide a unique key to unlock a deeper geological mystery.
