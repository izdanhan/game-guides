### **Character Creation Summary**

| Category | Selection | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | **Professor** | Provides the perfect scholarly foundation with starting skills in **Geology** (xeno-geology focus), **Surveying** (planetary analysis), and **Research Methods** (scientific rigor) . |
| **Traits** | **Introvert**, **Terra Firma**, **Taskmaster** | **Introvert** suits his solitary nature and provides a game-play benefit when alone. **Terra Firma** enhances his capabilities on planetary surfaces, his true laboratory. **Taskmaster** reflects his exacting standards as a leader, though he rarely uses crew . |
| **Body & Face** | **Older, Weathered Academic** | Choose a body type and face that reflects his age (50s+) and profession. Select a **serious, focused expression**. Use **refine options** to add subtle signs of stress and aging from a life of grief and intense study. Hair should be practical, perhaps graying. |
| **Name** | **Aris Thorne** | Finalize his identity. |

### Detailed Breakdown of Choices

#### **1. Background: Professor**
This is the only logical choice. The Professor background provides the following three starting skills, which are the absolute cornerstone of his build :
*   **Geology:** His entire life's work is the study of alien rocks and minerals. This skill doubles the yield of inorganic resources, which is essential for his research and crafting.
*   **Surveying:** The first step of The Grand Survey is scanning and analyzing planetary bodies. This increases the range of your scanner, making the process more efficient.
*   **Research Methods:** This skill reduces the resource cost for all research projects and unlocks higher-tier projects faster. For a craftsman and scientist, this is non-negotiable.

This background perfectly encapsulates his past life as a respected academic and provides the exact toolset needed for his journey.

#### **2. Traits (Choose 3)**
Traits add powerful role-playing and mechanical depth. The optimal choices for Dr. Thorne are:
*   **Introvert:** This is mandatory. His wife was his only partner; now he works best alone. Mechanically, this increases oxygen capacity when traveling without a companion, which he will do almost exclusively. It synergizes perfectly with his solitary nature .
*   **Terra Firma:** Years of study have attuned his body to planetary gravity. He feels more capable and clear-minded on a planet's surface. This trait provides a permanent bonus to health and oxygen while on the surface of a planet, which is where he will spend 90% of his time. The penalty to health and oxygen in space is a worthy trade-off for a character who sees his ship as a transport module, not a home .
*   **Taskmaster:** On the rare occasion he is forced to hire a crew for a specialized task, he is a demanding, exacting commander. This trait makes hired crew members more effective in their roles but costs significantly more to hire, reflecting his high standards and poor interpersonal skills. It’s a flavorful drawback that reinforces his personality.

**Traits to Avoid:**
*   **Extrovert:** Directly contradicts his entire personality.
*   **Hero Worshipped:** He has no patience for an annoying fan.
*   **Kid Stuff:** His focus is entirely on his work, not family.
*   **Dream Home:** The massive mortgage is a distracting financial burden for a character who reinvests all credits into research and ship upgrades.

#### **3. Appearance & Biometrics**
The goal is to create a man who looks like he has spent more time studying seismic readouts than sleeping.
*   **Biometric ID:** Select an older, mature base template. Look for faces with intelligent, intense, or weary expressions.
*   **Body Type:** Average or thin build. He is a scholar, not a soldier.
*   **Face:**
    *   Use the **refine options** to add slight wrinkles around the eyes and forehead, suggesting a life of squinting at data slates and geological samples.
    *   Choose a **practical, short hairstyle**, perhaps with graying tones.
    *   **Eyes** should be keen and observant. Consider a sharp, focused eye shape.
    *   Avoid flamboyant jewelry, tattoos, or makeup. He is a utilitarian scientist.
*   **Walk Style:** Choose the default walk. His movement is functional, not stylish.

### **First Steps in the Game**
Once you exit character creation, roleplay immediately begins:
1.  **Ignore the Main Quest:** After delivering the first Artifact to the Lodge and securing your membership with Constellation (a source of funding and data), politely decline further involvement. Their cosmic mystery is a distraction from your terrestrial one.
2.  **Fund The Grand Survey:** Your first credits should be spent on a **Better Cutter** from a merchant. Then, immediately start taking **Planetary Survey** and **Resource Procurement** missions from the Mission Board. These are not chores; they are funded expeditions.
3.  **Establish Your First Outpost:** Your first major goal is to establish a simple outpost on a mineral-rich moon like **Andraphon** in the Narion system to passively generate Iron, Aluminum, and Helium-3—the foundational resources for all future endeavors.

By making these choices, you will have perfectly translated the essence of Dr. Aris Thorne from a character concept into the game world, ready to begin his lonely, magnificent pilgrimage across the stars.

### Core Concept & Identity
*   **Archetype:** The Grieving Scholar-Obsessive
*   **Vocation:** Xeno-Geologist & Independent Researcher
*   **Ship:** *The Forge* (A beat-up, modified Kepler-class scout ship)
*   **Defining Quote:** *"Every rock has a story. You just need to know how to listen. The ones out here… they sing songs of creation itself. And I intend to transcribe every last note."*

### Defining History & Motivations
*   **The Past:** A respected but unfulfilled Professor of Xeno-Geology at the University of Olympion on Mars. His life was theory and academia until it was shattered by the death of his wife and research partner, Elara, from a rare illness linked to unrefined Tiberium exposure.
*   **The Turning Point:** Her death caused a fundamental break. He rejected the "safe" confines of institutional science, liquidated his assets, and exiled himself into the void to pursue raw, hands-on discovery.
*   **The Grand Mission:** He is consumed by **The Grand Survey**, a self-appointed, obsessive quest to find a theoretical **"Primordial Litho-Key"**—a perfect crystalline structure he believes underpins all cosmic matter. This is his life's work, his penance, and his memorial to Elara.
*   **The Driving Force:** The belief that the universe's ultimate answers (to formation, artifacts, even human biology) are encoded not in words, but in the mineralogical DNA of planets. He seeks truth, not glory; understanding, not wealth.

### Psychological Profile & Roleplay Guidelines
*   **Disposition:** Terse, precise, and factual. He speaks in observations, not emotions. Becomes animated only when discussing geology, xenobiology, or engineering.
*   **Solitude as a Weapon:** His focus is sharpened by isolation. Crowds and small talk are a drain; the silent company of the stars is his solace.
*   **The Craftsman's Pride:** He holds contempt for the unprepared. Off-the-shelf gear is for amateurs; a true scientist engineers their own solutions. He modifies and improves everything he owns.
*   **Pragmatic Morality:** He is **True Neutral**. His morality is dictated by his mission. He won't harm innocents but will break any regulation or "appropriate" any resource if it serves the greater scientific purpose of The Grand Survey. The ends justify the means if the ends are knowledge.

### Traits & Their Roleplay Effects
*   **Introvert:**
    *   **Effect:** Works best alone. Finds companions draining over long periods.
    *   **Roleplay:** Prefers solo exploration. Hires crew only for specific, temporary tasks. His only true partner was his wife; without her, he relies on himself and his ship.
*   **Terra Firma:**
    *   **Effect:** Feels more capable and clear-minded on planetary surfaces.
    *   **Roleplay:** A planet's surface is his laboratory, a ship is a necessary transport module. He will always choose a path that keeps him grounded. He feels uneasy and confined in space stations or during long hauls.
*   **Taskmaster:**
    *   **Effect:** Demands precision and excellence from any hired crew.
    *   **Roleplay:** On the rare occasions he requires a crew, he is an exacting, demanding commander. He has no patience for error or laziness, often grating on those who don't share his obsessive standards. He barks orders with cold efficiency.

### The Call to Adventure
The Starfield is not a place of adventure for Aris Thorne; it is a library. Every new anomaly is a page to be read, every mineral signature a footnote to be decoded. He is a cartographer of creation's blueprint. He will brave pirate fleets, extreme environments, and profound loneliness to ask the oldest questions of the oldest stones, hoping one will finally answer. The main quest and faction dramas are merely distractions unless they provide a unique key to unlock a deeper geological mystery.
