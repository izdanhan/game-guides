### **ACT I: THE INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER (Levels 1-25)**

-   **Objective:** Establish your financial and material independence. Acquire your core tools and a functional mobile base of operations.
-   **Main Quest:** Follow the "Old Neighborhood" quest to acquire your first Artifact and be introduced to Constellation. This organization is not your purpose, but a means to an end‚Äîa source of funding, information, and access to otherwise restricted astronomical data. **Stop after delivering the Artifact to the Lodge.** Your membership is now secured; their larger quest is a distraction for now.
-   **The Essential Questline:**
    -   **UC Vanguard Flight Simulation:** Complete this immediately. It is a trivial test of basic acumen, but the reward is a **full UC Citizenship**, granting you legal landing rights in the Core Systems. This is a practical necessity, not an ideological commitment.
    -   **First Contact (Paradiso):** This is a quintessential Aris Thorne problem: a first-contact scenario rooted in resource allocation and historical data. The scientific implications are profound. Pursue the peaceful resolution; the rewards include unique access to their generational ship's data core, a treasure trove of long-term environmental and sociological data.
-   **The Scholarly Grind:**
    -   Your primary "quests" are from the Mission Boards: **Planetary Survey** and **Resource Procurement** missions. These are not chores; they are funded expeditions that directly serve The Grand Survey.
    -   Establish your first basic Outpost on a moon like **Andraphon** or **Kreet** for a reliable, passive income of Iron, Aluminum, and Helium-3.
    -   Your single most important goal is to achieve **Rank 3 in Research Methods** to unlock all research tiers. Everything else is secondary.
-   **Ship & Gear:** All credits must be funneled into upgrading **The Frontier's** cargo capacity (Payloads skill) and grav drive. Your first major purchase should be a **Better Cutter**. You are a craftsman; do not buy a new ship, *improve* the one you have.

### **ACT II: THE PIONEERING GEOLOGIST (Levels 25-50)**

-   **Objective:** Expand your outpost network into a multi-system operation. Deepen your research capabilities to survive and document extreme environments.
-   **The Turning Point:** You have proven your capabilities. Now, delve into the questlines that offer unique scientific returns.
    -   **Entangled (NASA Mission on Mars):** This is not a mere dungeon crawl. It is a hands-on study of a localized gravitational anomaly and a historical archive of Earth's pre-collapse technology. The data here is invaluable.
    -   **Juno Gambit (Space Encounter):** A unique opportunity to study a pre-war AI's evolution and make a truly scientific determination on its fate. Record everything.
    -   **Faction - Ryujin Industries:** Infiltrate this corporation not for profit, but for access to their **Industrial Workbench** and the unique **Manipulation** skill. The ability to ethically-compromised command a subject to hand over a keycard or stand down is the ultimate field research tool.
-   **Advanced Operations:**
    -   Establish a second outpost in a system with a **Temperate (Tau Ceti II) or Extreme (Zeta Ophiuchi I) environment** to farm organic and rare inorganic resources.
    -   Begin the research and construction of a **Class B ship**. You need a vessel capable of carrying more cargo, with a powerful reactor to support advanced scanning equipment, and strong shields to weather the punishing environments of high-level systems.
-   **Daedric Pilgrimage (Starfield Equivalents):** It is time to seek powerful, unique tools.
    -   **The Mantis Lair:** Solve the "Secret Outpost" puzzle. The reward, the **Razorleaf** ship and **Mantis armor set**, is a powerful early-game boost, but you are there for the data: a complete case study on spacefaring paranoia and its effects on technological development.
    -   **Colander Ship (Schrodinger III):** A derelict ship filled with gruesome mysteries. Board it. Document the cause of the incident. It is a terrifying but vital field report on deep-space isolation and xenological hazards.

### **ACT III: THE MASTER OF THE GRAND SURVEY (Levels 50+)**

-   **Objective:** Attain self-sufficient perfection. Construct a mobile capital ship capable of being your sole base of operations. Complete your survey of the cosmos.
-   **Faction - United Colonies / SysDef:**
    -   Engage with the **UC Vanguard** questline fully. Your goal is not to be a hero, but to gain **full access to the MAST archival database** and the military's advanced ship technology.
    -   Alternatively, infiltrate the **Crimson Fleet** for SysDef. Your goal is not justice, but to gain unrestricted access to the **Key's** immense black market, the single best source for rare, pre-stolen resources and contraband scientific samples.
-   **Constellation's Endgame:** You have avoided their metaphysical obsession until now. With your scientific foundation complete, you are finally equipped to study the **Artifacts** and **Temples** not as religious relics, but as physical anomalies to be measured, scanned, and understood. The data they emit is the ultimate prize.
-   **The Ultimate Project:**
    -   Your final outpost must be a self-sufficient marvel on a **level 75 planet** in a system like **Serpentis** or **Leviathan**. It should manufacture everything you need from base resources.
    -   Using **Starship Design 4** and **Piloting 4**, design and build your ultimate vessel: a **Class C capital ship (The Forge Mk. II)**. It must contain all crafting stations, extensive cargo, research labs, and enough crew capacity for the handful of specialists you tolerate. This ship is your masterpiece and your permanent home.
-   **The Final Survey:** Your end-game is 100% survey completion of every planet and moon within your chosen purview. This is your legacy. The data you sell to Vladimir Sall will fund a lifetime of further research, and the archives you build in your outposts will stand long after you are gone, a testament to the pursuit of pure knowledge.

## üó∫Ô∏è Regional Guide: How to Behave in the Settled Systems

-   **New Atlantis (Jemison):** A necessary bureaucracy. Use the Well and the Commercial District for all your commerce. The MAST district is a library to be exploited for data. Lodge meetings are a tedious obligation. Be polite, efficient, and leave as quickly as possible.
-   **Akila City (Akila):** A study in rugged individualism overcoming a hostile environment. Useful for acquiring practical, no-nonsense gear and hiring skilled labourers like Heller. The harsh terrain outside the walls is a fascinating subject for geological survey.
-   **Neon (Volii Alpha):** A blight of corporate hedonism built on a poisoned fishery. A fascinating case study in societal collapse and environmental exploitation. Tolerate it only to acquire the unique resources and cybernetic research available in the Underbelly. Your **Manipulation** skill is invaluable here.
-   **Cydonia (Mars):** Home. A place of quiet industry and profound history. The mineral wealth of Mars is still largely untapped. The people here understand the value of hard work and science. This is one of the few places you can tolerate for extended periods.
-   **The Key (Kryx):** A lawless den of vipers. Do not come here without a purpose, overwhelming firepower, or SysDef backing. It is, however, the galaxy's best resource market. Be cold, professional, and never turn your back on anyone.
-   **The Empty Quarter (Deep Space):** This is where you belong. The uncharted systems, the rogue planets, the grav jump anomalies. This is your true laboratory, where the songs of the stones are unsullied by the noise of civilization.

This path will transform you from a grieving academic into a master of your craft, a sovereign entity of science capable of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets. Now go, and transcribe the song of the stars.
