### **The Lore: "The Stone and the Starfield"**

**"Every rock has a story. You just need to know how to listen. The ones out here… they sing songs of creation itself. And I intend to transcribe every last note."**

Dr. Aris Thorne was not a man built for crowds or colonies. To him, the bustling corridors of Jemison's MAST Academy felt more alien than the most desolate moon of Zeta Ophiuchi. He was a relic of a bygone era of science, a hands-on geologist who believed true understanding came not from data-slates, but from the grit of regolith beneath your gloves and the subsonic hum of a core sample.

For two decades, he was the foremost Professor of Xeno-Geology at the University of Olympion on Mars. His was a quiet, respected life of lectures, research papers, and theory. But theory began to feel like a cage. It was the sudden, quiet death of his wife and research partner, Elara, from a rare cellular degradation—a sickness whispered to be linked to long-term exposure to unrefined Tiberium deposits—that shattered the cage entirely.

Grief-stricken and disillusioned with the "safe" confines of institutional science, Thorne resigned. He liquidated his assets, purchased a beat-up, second-generation Kepler-class scout ship he christened **The Forge**, and vanished into the uncharted reaches of the Settled Systems.

His former colleagues think he's cracked. A brilliant mind lost to grief and isolation. They are wrong.

Aris Thorne is on a singular, obsessive mission: **The Grand Survey**. He believes the ultimate answers—to the universe's formation, to the secrets of the artifacts, perhaps even to anomalies of human biology like the one that took Elara—are not written in words, but encoded in the very mineralogical DNA of the cosmos. He seeks a theoretical "Primordial Litho-Key," a common, perfect crystalline structure that could underpin all matter.

He is a craftsman because he must be. His quest takes him to extremes of pressure, temperature, and radiation where off-the-shelf equipment fails. He must engineer his own suits to survive corrosive atmospheres, modify his tools to crack alien alloys, and build outposts on forgotten worlds to fuel his lonely pilgrimage.

He is an explorer because there is no other choice. The answers aren't on the well-trodden paths between Jemison and Akila. They are in the silent, diamond-ring systems, on the rogue planets drifting between stars, and in the deep, seismic fractures of dead worlds.

**The Traits, Explained:**

*   **Introvert:** His wife was his only true partner. Without her, he finds solace only in silence, his work, and the endless, honest company of the stars. He works best alone, his focus sharpened by isolation.
*   **Terra Firma:** Years of study have attuned his body to planetary gravity. He feels more grounded, more capable, his mind clearest when his boots are planted on a world, reading its geological history. The confines of a ship are a necessary evil; a planet's surface is his laboratory.
*   **Taskmaster:** On the rare occasion he is forced to hire a crew for a complex operation, he is a demanding, exacting commander. There is no room for error in the void. He expects the same relentless precision from others that he demands of himself, often grating on those who don't share his obsession.

**The Call to Adventure:**

The Starfield calls to Aris not for glory or wealth, but for truth. Every new anomaly, every mineral signature, every strange artifact is another piece of the puzzle. He is a seeker of silent truths, a cartographer of creation's blueprint, one painstakingly gathered sample at a time. He will brave pirate fleets, extreme environments, and the profound loneliness of the void to ask the oldest questions of the oldest stones, hoping one will finally answer.
